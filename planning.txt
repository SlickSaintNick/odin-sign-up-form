Horizontal flex:
div 'left'
div 'right'

In left we have:
logo
image credit

In right we have:
banner
form
footer (which includes the submit button)

So a horizontal flex for the left and right, and vertical flex for the rest.
Within the form itself we also have columns which we will probably deal with flex or media-query.
